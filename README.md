### Hook Practice
The purpose of this project is to gain a basic understanding of React Hooks!  Through my personal education at Turing School of Software and Design, we learned React pre-16.8.  The older version of React took advantage of Class Components to create state.  With the addition of React Hooks in 16.8 it is now possible to organize logic in components, making them tiny and reusable without writing a class.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
